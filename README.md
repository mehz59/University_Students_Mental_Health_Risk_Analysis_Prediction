This project aims to predict the mental health risk of university students by analyzing key factors like stress levels, sleep quality, financial stress, social support, and more.
The goal is to identify students who may be at risk of anxiety or depression early enough to provide support before things get worse.

As a university student myself, I’ve witnessed how common these struggles are. I’ve personally experienced phases of stress, burnout, and feeling overwhelmed.
I’ve also seen close friends face similar challenges, often silently. What struck me most is how many of us don’t realize the seriousness of these issues until it’s too late.
We tend to normalize stress and ignore our mental health, just trying to “push through.” That’s why I decided to build this project.


In developing it, I explored a real-life dataset and used mostly basic Python and machine learning to uncover patterns and create a simple tool anyone can use for a quick mental health risk assessment.
I believe data isn’t just numbers.it’s a way to tell stories and highlight issues that truly matter. 
I hope this small effort encourages others to reflect on their well-being or even sparks conversations that lead to positive change.
